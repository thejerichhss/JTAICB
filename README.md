# JTAICB
*JTAICB*, (or *Jerich's Terminal AI Chatbot*) is **Gemini, but in a terminal.** (Works with WSL!) (NOW VOICED!) (*Disclaimer*: Replace "*GEMINIAPIKEY_PLACEDHERE*" in the .sh file with a *"Gemini API Key",* You can get one [**here**](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) also **GEMINI IS PROPERTY OF *Google*.** ) (Disclaimer PS: *I cannot and will not take any responsibilities for misuse of this program.*) (Disclaimer PPS: *This version is in beta, so things can go wrong*) (Disclaimer PPPS: *This uses OpenAI's "Whisper" to recognize speech. also this records your voice for 10 seconds instead of stopping when you stop talking, I will fix this issue soon.*)
